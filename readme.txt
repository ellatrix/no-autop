Disables wpautop.

== Description ==

This plugin disables `wpautop`. Paragraphs will no longer be removed from the visual editor, and the text editor will need to be used as a pure HTML editor. Old posts will still be formatted until they are saved again.

Disabling this plugin will leave posts edited during activation as they are. A known issue is that auto embedding will not work for those posts. This plugin is meant to stay active or to be used as a must-use plugin.
